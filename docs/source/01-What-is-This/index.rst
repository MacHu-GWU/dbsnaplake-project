What is dbsnaplake
==============================================================================


Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dbsnaplake (Database Snapshot Data Lake) is a framework that converts any database snapshot into an analytics-friendly data lake. It leverages a divide-and-conquer approach to process large volumes of data in parallel, enabling users to write minimal code for adapting various database sources, implementing custom transformation logic, and outputting to different data lake (or data warehouse) systems. The framework provides a functional programming interface, allowing for extensive customization of every aspect of the data processing pipeline.


Database to Data Lake Conversion Approaches
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are typically two methods for converting databases into data lakes:

1. **Periodic Export and Process (Batch Processing)**
    - Implementation: Create a cron job to export database data, process it, and load it into the data lake.
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons:
        - Potentially high data latency
        - May not be suitable for extremely large databases

2. **Snapshot with Continuous Data Capture (Real-time Processing)**
    - Implementation: Load a point-in-time snapshot of the database into the data lake, then use Change Data Capture (CDC) streams to continuously hydrate incremental data in near real-time.
    - Pros: Low data latency
    - Cons: More complex to implement and manage

``dbsnaplake`` focuses on optimizing the #1 approach. For enterprises interested in the second method, please contact us for information about our separate enterprise solution.


The Python Library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``dbsnaplake`` is distributed as a versatile Python library that:

- Remains agnostic to specific database types and data lake/warehouse systems
- Provides a robust toolkit for building custom data pipelines tailored to your use case
- Minimizes the amount of code required to create efficient, scalable data processing workflows

By leveraging dbsnaplake, data engineers and analysts can rapidly develop and deploy data pipelines that transform database snapshots into analytics-ready data lakes, unlocking the full potential of their data assets.

Also, most of my enterprise solution are built on top of this library.
